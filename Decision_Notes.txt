On Test case #3:

   Possible Solutions:
            -> Could've Implemented Regex, but I have to learn a bit on pattern matching
            -> 

   Solution: 
            Implemented a 3rd case for bold and italic text using contains("***").
            The current solution might be clunky but I may be able to locate the abstraction 
            in the duplication of the code since it operates on substring indexes and
            enclosing of a content.
