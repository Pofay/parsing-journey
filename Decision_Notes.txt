On Test case #3:

   Possible Solutions:
            -> Could've Implemented Regex, but I have to learn a bit on pattern matching
            -> 

   Solution: 
            Implemented a 3rd case for bold and italic text using contains("***").
            The current solution might be clunky but I may be able to locate the abstraction 
            in the duplication of the code since it operates on substring indexes and
            enclosing of a content.

On Test case #4:

    
    Problems using previous solution:
            With the proliferation of contains(), its very hard to extract [Link Text](LinkURL). Even when you can extract
            the [Link] and (LinkURL) theres no guarantee that it can be merged together during a replace in <a href> without
            writing alot of string manipulation code

    Possible Solution:
            -> Refactoring to use a regex

    Problem with Solution:
            The Learning Curve is a bit high, with limited time to learn.
